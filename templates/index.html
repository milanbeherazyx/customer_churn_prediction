    <h1>Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction App</h1>
    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Customer Churn Prediction</p>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical challenge faced by businesses, especially those in the subscription-based industry. Accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn is essential for retaining valuable customers and reducing revenue loss. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for predicting customer churn based on various customer attributes and behavior data.</p>
    
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>The primary goal of this project is to predict customer churn, i.e., the likelihood that a customer will discontinue their subscription or stop using a service. By analyzing historical customer data and employing machine learning techniques, the model aims to identify patterns and relationships between customer features and the probability of churn. The predictive model will enable businesses to proactively address customer retention strategies and reduce churn rates.</p>
    
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>This project follows a typical machine learning workflow, encompassing data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and model evaluation. Various machine learning algorithms and techniques are explored to determine the most effective approach for customer churn prediction. Additionally, the project may involve the utilization of advanced tools and libraries for data analysis and model training.</p>
    
    <h3>Expected Results</h3>
    <p>The project aims to deliver a robust machine learning solution capable of accurately predicting customer churn. The trained model will take customer attributes and historical behavior data as input and provide a prediction of the likelihood of churn. This predictive capability empowers businesses to implement customer retention strategies, personalize customer experiences, and ultimately reduce churn rates, leading to increased customer satisfaction and revenue.</p>
